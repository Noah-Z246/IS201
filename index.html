                        <p>I’m currently a pre-business major at BYU in Provo, driven by a deep desire to learn, grow,
                            and make a meaningful impact. I recently returned from serving a religious mission in Upstate 
                            New York, where I developed a love for God and for the people I served. That experience 
                            strengthened my communication skills, deepened my empathy, and taught me the importance of 
                            service—qualities I aim to carry into both my future career and family life. I'm 
                            passionate about personal growth, meaningful connections, and building a life centered on 
                            purpose and contribution.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Noah_Zwinggi_Photo.png" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>Since beginning my college education, I’ve developed a strong interest in various aspects 
                            of business, especially marketing, business management, and entrepreneurship. I’ve gained 
                            hands-on experience in building and promoting business ideas and have grown confident 
                            working with tools in information systems. My technical skills include VBA, SQL, HTML, 
                            and database organization and analysis. These skills are helping me build a solid 
                            foundation for my future in business and technology.</p>
                        <p>Outside of academics and professional interests, I’m someone who values connection, 
                            creativity, and meaningful experiences. In my free time, I enjoy fishing, playing 
                            pickleball, watching movies, and both attending and participating in musical theater 
                            productions. I also deeply value quality time with family and friends and believe in 
                            building relationships that last.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Noah_Zwinggi_Fishing.png" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>Above all, I strive to love and serve God in everything I do. My goal is to reflect His 
                            light through my words, actions, and the way I treat others—whether in the classroom, 
                            the workplace, or at home. I believe that true success comes not just from achievement, 
                            but from doing good in His sight and building a life centered on faith, service, and integrity.</p>
